OFMS is a re-implentation of FIRST's FMS for controlling robots in an event. This software is used to control 3v3 matches with real-time scoring and year-specfic elements. 



PLC Integration:

We use Automation Direct's FMS Hardware, which consits of a DoMore BRX PLC and many remote network cards to control inputs and outputs of the field.



Scoring: 

Scoring is handled by the PLC and the Ref Touchpanels which are the C-More Panels



Networking:

We recommend to use the Linksys 1900ACS* Access Point and a Cisco 3500 series L3 Switch*  flashed with the provided Configurations in the project files.



Field Lighting:

For 2018 the field lighing will be controlled by 3 arduinos and WS2812B led pixel strips. The arduino program can be used on any arduino 
but we are using the Arduino Uno Rev 3.



Release Info:

We will be releasing a version of this software every year to fit the new FRC game along with new technology updates. 



*The Hardware list will be avalible on request and the same with the PLC program.
